# CSS Blur Filter Issue on Elements with Zero Dimensions

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `filter: blur()` property.  The blur effect unexpectedly fails to render when applied to an element with dimensions set to 0 or `auto`, potentially leading to unexpected visual results in web applications.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to this problem.

## Problem:

Applying `filter: blur()` to an element with zero dimensions (width or height) or dimensions set to `auto` often results in the filter having no effect.  The element's visual appearance remains unchanged, despite the filter being applied.
