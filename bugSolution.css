To resolve the issue, ensure the element has explicitly defined non-zero dimensions. Avoid using `auto` for width and height unless you intend to let the content determine the size, but then still ensure there's content to render.  Here's how to fix it:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  width: 100px; /* Define a specific width */
  height: 100px; /* Define a specific height */
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```
Setting the explicit dimensions will cause the blur filter to render correctly.
